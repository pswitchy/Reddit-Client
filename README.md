A browser-based Reddit client that displays multiple subreddits in separate, customizable lanes. Works with the Reddit JSON feed to fetch posts from different subreddits and display them in a dynamic, responsive layout.

The application will allow users to add new subreddit lanes by entering a subreddit name. It will verify the existence of the subreddit, fetch its posts, and display them in a new lane. Each lane will show the subredditâ€™s posts, including titles, authors, and vote counts.
